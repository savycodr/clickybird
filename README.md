This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Clicky Bird
A memory game played by clicking on images of birds. The challenge is not to click on the same bird twice. After each click the images will shuffle around.

## Instructions
1. Visit the [Clicky Bird](https://clickybird.herokuapp.com/) website. 
2. Click on a bird image.
3. Continue until you have clicked the same image twice. Your game will reset and you can begin again. The game will keep track of the high score for the session.

## Technology
* This app uses a stateful React component to keep track of the scores and the image locations.
* The app uses a stateless React component to display the bird images.
* The app is deployed on Heroku.
* The HTML uses Bootstrap CSS libraries.
* The animation is created using Animate.css.
